# Pocket Provider Dashboard

Public-facing Pocket Network dashboard focused on service demand, reward trends, and provider onboarding economics without naming or ranking commercial providers.

## Branch Scope

- `main`: PNF-safe public dashboard. It does not expose named provider leaderboards, provider detail pages, staker rankings, supplier playbooks, or per-provider service mix in the UI or public dashboard API payloads.
- `provider`: operator/provider intelligence edition preserved from the pre-PNF-feedback dashboard. It includes named provider rankings, provider detail reports, staker yield rankings, and infrastructure deep dives for private operator analysis.

## Overview

This project is a Next.js app that turns live Pocket Network data into a simple provider-side market view.

The current public demo focuses on:

- aggregate provider-side revenue across `24h`, `7d`, and `30d` windows
- relay demand across active services
- high-demand services, supplier competition, and service opportunity scoring
- a growth calculator for early provider planning

## Current Product Scope

This repository does **not** implement the full RC1 architecture described in the technical docs yet.

Today, the project is intentionally lightweight:

- a Next.js application for the UI and read-only API routes
- a separate Node.js indexer for Pocket RPC/WebSocket data collection
- a compact local SQLite store for indexed settlement facts, metadata, and dashboard snapshots
- direct Pocket RPC as the primary source of truth
- a legacy `Poktscan` ingestion worker kept temporarily as fallback while the indexer is validated
- provider grouping at the domain level inside the ingestion model, with named provider data removed from public `main` surfaces

That makes it a good public demo, but not yet a full historical analytics product backed by a dedicated indexer.

## Data Sources

The dashboard uses an indexer-first data strategy.

### Primary path: Pocket RPC indexer

The `pocket-indexer` process subscribes to CometBFT new blocks over WebSocket, repairs missing heights from the last retention window over HTTP RPC, parses `EventClaimSettled`, and writes compact settlement facts to SQLite. The UI reads only materialized SQLite cache payloads.

Live indexing and historical repair run in the same process. A fresh or partially indexed database can start in production immediately: WebSocket tailing follows new blocks while the repair loop fills gaps in the last `POCKET_INDEXER_RETENTION_DAYS` in the background.

### Legacy fallback: `Poktscan`

The older `npm run worker` ingestion path can still populate snapshots through `Poktscan` and RPC fallback, but it is no longer the preferred production data path.

### Legacy RPC fallback semantics

The legacy `npm run worker` path can fall back to Pocket Shannon RPC and read settlement information from `end_block_events`.

In fallback mode it:

- uses `block_search` to find recent blocks containing `EventClaimSettled`
- fetches only a recent sample of settlement blocks per time window
- skips slow or heavy `block_results` responses automatically

In this mode, provider-side revenue is computed from the supplier-side share inside `reward_distribution_detailed`.

## Demo Semantics

Some details are important when reading the numbers shown in the UI.

- The public dashboard shows provider-domain metrics only as aggregate counts, averages, medians, and concentration measures.
- Named provider rankings and provider-level operational detail are intentionally out of scope for `main`.
- The preserved `provider` branch keeps the provider/operator edition for private analysis.
- USD values are derived from the live CoinGecko price for `pocket-network`.
- Time windows are based on settlement block time from indexed Pocket blocks.
- The growth calculator is deliberately simple and designed to provide plausible onboarding guidance, not exact protocol-level forecasting.

## Default Endpoints

- RPC pool:
  - `https://sauron-rpc.infra.pocket.network`
  - `https://pocket-rpc.polkachu.com:443`
  - `https://rpc.pocket.chaintools.tech:443`
  - `https://pocket.api.pocket.network:443`
- REST:
  - `https://sauron-api.infra.pocket.network`

## Environment Variables

Optional overrides:

- `POCKET_RPC_URL`
- `POCKET_RPC_URLS` comma-separated custom RPC pool
- `POCKET_REST_URL`
- `POKTSCAN_API_URL`
- `POCKET_SQLITE_PATH`

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run ingest
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

The UI reads local SQLite snapshots only. Run `npm run ingest` before opening the app on a fresh database.

## Production Runtime

Run the web process and indexer separately:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
npm run indexer
```

With PM2:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name pocket-dashboard -- run start
pm2 start npm --name pocket-indexer -- run indexer
```

The indexer owns all Pocket RPC/WebSocket requests and writes dashboard snapshots to SQLite. The Next.js request path does not call Pocket RPC or Poktscan directly. `npm run indexer:backfill` remains available for manual/debug runs, but production should normally only run `npm run indexer`.

Temporary legacy fallback:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name pocket-worker -- run worker
```

Optional worker interval override:

```bash
POCKET_INGEST_INTERVAL_MS=3600000 npm run worker
```

Indexer commands:

```bash
npm run indexer
npm run indexer:once
npm run indexer:backfill
tsx scripts/indexer.ts --from-height 123456 --to-height 124000 --once
```

Backfill uses concurrent RPC reads and writes checkpoints in height order. For production backfills, tune throughput conservatively against your RPC pool:

```bash
POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY=8 POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE=500 npm run indexer:backfill
```

If the RPC pool is slow or rate-limited, reduce concurrency and increase the per-request timeout. The indexer retries failed RPC calls across the full node pool before aborting, and progress logs include per-node success/failure/timeout counters.

```bash
POCKET_INDEXER_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS=30000 POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY=2 POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE=100 npm run indexer:backfill
```

Indexer environment variables:

- `POCKET_RPC_URLS` comma-separated RPC pool used for WebSocket and HTTP fallback
- `POCKET_BACKFILL_RPC_URLS` optional comma-separated RPC pool used first for repair/backfill reads
- `POCKET_INDEXER_START_HEIGHT` optional first height when no checkpoint exists
- `POCKET_INDEXER_RETENTION_DAYS` defaults to `45`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_CACHE_INTERVAL_MS` defaults to `30000`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` defaults to `8000`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_RPC_RETRIES` defaults to `3` attempts across the RPC pool
- `POCKET_INDEXER_RPC_RETRY_DELAY_MS` defaults to `500`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_BLOCK_RETRIES` defaults to `5` height-level retries
- `POCKET_INDEXER_AVG_BLOCK_SECONDS` defaults to `60` for Pocket backfill height estimation
- `POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_CONCURRENCY` defaults to `8`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_BACKFILL_BATCH_SIZE` defaults to `500`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_REPAIR_INTERVAL_MS` defaults to `60000`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_REPAIR_BATCH_SIZE` defaults to `250`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_REPAIR_CONCURRENCY` defaults to `4`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_REPAIR_FAILED_COOLDOWN_MS` defaults to `300000`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_REPAIR_MAX_FAILED_RETRIES` defaults to `10`
- `POCKET_INDEXER_LIVE_CATCHUP_MAX_BLOCKS` defaults to `1000`; live mode skips stale checkpoints with larger gaps instead of replaying history
- `POCKET_INDEXER_HASH_SALT` salt for privacy-preserving supplier/operator hashes
- `POCKET_UI_MEMORY_CACHE_MS` defaults to `30000`

## Verification

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

## Caching

The app uses:

- SQLite persistence for settlement blocks, metadata, and dashboard snapshots
- compact indexed settlement facts with a default 45-day retention window
- `job_runs` records for ingestion success/failure tracking
- materialized UI JSON cache payloads read directly by Next.js

This keeps the public demo responsive and reduces repeated network fetches.

## Repository Context

If you want the longer-term direction for the project, see:

- `TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`
- `ROADMAP.md`

Those documents describe the path toward a more rigorous RC1 architecture. The implementation in this repository is the current public demo version.
